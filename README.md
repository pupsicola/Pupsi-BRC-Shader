Special thanks to Muppo for allowing me to implement their glow/scroll implementation as well as StonyOnBRC for testing and feedback!

### Current Features:
- 1:1 brc lighting and outlines
- shadow and light softness, offset, and custom tint options
- support for normal maps
- custom rim light/shadow with optional base texture blending
- optional specular lighting options with masking
- custom colored outline with custom width and optional base texture blending
- optional extra lighting pass
- screen space shadow texture overlay
- screen space options with scrolling, emission, and masking
- additive cubemap reflections with masking
- base texture scrolling and rotation with masking
- emission hue shift, scrolling, rotation, and masking
- glow masking and cycling
- flipbook textures and masking

Partial transparencies are not supported at the moment and alpha clipping is based on the alpha of the base texture of a given material.

Feel free to submit suggestions for new features.

#### I hope this helps you with your creations and I hope you enjoy!
